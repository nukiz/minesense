## What is this?

Minesense is an unfinished external ghost client for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Features include:
- FakeLag
- Reach
- Autoclicker
- Airjump and other miscellaneous movement features
- Customizable velocity with chance%, H% and V% and anticombo.
- Comeback Assist (cranks settings to max when under hp threshold, and returns them shortly after)
- Customization for the client, with intended Lua scripting API for customizable modules
- Discord RPC

However most of these features are very primitive (fakelag..) and some dont even exist yet (velocity etc)
Client is very customizable.

## Dependencies

Minesense uses many dependencies. These include: 
- DiscordRPC.dll | Used for the Discord Rich Presence used by the client
- KeraLua, NLua etc. | To be used for the upcoming Lua API
- Newtonsoft.Json | To be used for the upcoming configs system, also a dependency of DiscordRPC.dll.
- Memory.dll | Library used to read/write the game's memory for the cheats (very primitive... but easy to use!)
